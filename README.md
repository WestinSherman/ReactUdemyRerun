# ReactUdemyRerun
Mar/18th/2025:
    S_60(603), did 0 code.
    S_60(604), created a React Codesandbox.
    S_60(605), learned that Babel is what renders our JSX (Javascript Syntax Extension) from non legal Javascript to legal Javascript.
    S_60(606), learned that "App" should be the top level component of the entire application. This "App" component is a function.
    S_60(607), Colt just shows how to declare two components on the App file. Which I wouldn't do. I think your supposed to declare them seperately.
