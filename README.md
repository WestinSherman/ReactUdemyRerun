# ReactUdemyRerun
Mar/18th/2025:
    S_60(603), did 0 code.
    S_60(604), created a React Codesandbox.
    S_60(605), learned that Babel is what renders our JSX (Javascript Syntax Extension) from non legal Javascript to legal Javascript.
    S_60(606), learned that "App" should be the top level component of the entire application. This "App" component is a function.
    S_60(607), Colt just shows how to declare two components on the App file. Which I wouldn't do. I think your supposed to declare them seperately.
    S_61(608), We don't declare multiple components in the same file. Each Component should get its own file. The files show be named the same as the function/component. To export multiple functions at once, you wrap the function name with Curly Brackets({}).
    S_60(609), A component can only return a single element but the element can have many child elements.
